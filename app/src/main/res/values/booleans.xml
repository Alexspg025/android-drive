     `WindowInsetsControllerCompat.setAppearanceLightStatusBars` which is used by
     `systemUiController.setStatusBarColor` when setting the `darkIcons` to false doesn't actually
     set the icons colors, it either forces the status bar icons to use the white color (light
     status bar) or revert to the theme's default as described in
     https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/180250984.
     Making the status bar not light by default allows us to force the light status bar at runtime
     and go back to dark when needed.
